--Dataset:
--The 3 key datasets for this case study are:
--a. Continent: The Continent table has two attributes i.e., region_id and region_name, where region_name consists of different continents such as Asia, Europe, Africa etc., assigned with the unique region id.
--b. Customers: The Customers table has four attributes named customer_id, region_id, start_date and end_date which consists of 3500 records.
--c. Transaction: Finally, the Transaction table contains around 5850 records and has four attributes named customer_id, txn_date, txn_type and txn_amount.



--1. Display the count of customers in each region who have done the transaction in the year 2020.
--2. Display the maximum and minimum transaction amount of each transaction type.
--3. Display the customer id, region name and transaction amount where transaction type is deposit and transaction amount > 2000.
--4. Find duplicate records in the Customer table.
--5. Display the customer id, region name, transaction type and transaction amount for the minimum transaction amount in deposit.
--6. Create a stored procedure to display details of customers in the Transaction table where the transaction date is greater than Jun 2020.
--7. Create a stored procedure to insert a record in the Continent table.
--8. Create a stored procedure to display the details of transactions that happened on a specific day.
--9. Create a user defined function to add 10% of the transaction amount in a table.
--10. Create a user defined function to find the total transaction amount for a given transaction type.
--11. Create a table value function which comprises the columns customer_id, region_id ,txn_date , txn_type , txn_amount which will retrieve data from the above table.
--12. Create a TRY...CATCH block to print a region id and region name in a single column.
--13. Create a TRY...CATCH block to insert a value in the Continent table.
--14. Create a trigger to prevent deleting a table in a database.
--15. Create a trigger to audit the data in a table.
--16. Create a trigger to prevent login of the same user id in multiple pages.
--17. Display top n customers on the basis of transaction type.
--18. Create a pivot table to display the total purchase, withdrawal and deposit for all the customers
